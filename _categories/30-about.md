Hi! My name is **Christopher Aue**. I'm a freelance web and Magento developer from Münster, Germany. This is my personal blog, that happens to be mostly about frontend development up to now. Besides my work, I nurture my skill as a **software engineer** and try to get the hang of **product development** and **marketing**.

Right now I'm building **[Capp](http://www.getcapp.com)**, an app to remember and restore running applications for Mac and Linux:

My passion to use the computer to create stuff flared up as a kid while playing around with Corel Draw (I guess, it was version 4) on my home's computer. After discovering the web I was quickly drawn into web design, taught myself programming and also tried a lot of different things from 3D modelling and animation to creating mods for games. After **studying physics** and graduating from university I decided to turn my passion to profession which led me to join the **startup** [Grünspar](http://www.gruenspar.de) as a web and Magento developer. After two years of working there I quit to be able to shift my focus more into the direction of product development.

To balance things out for me I spend my free time doing **Ving Tsun Kung Fu**, a fascinating martial skill for close combat. It utilizes short, fast and dynamic punches that keep the opponent under constant pressure and provoke him to make mistakes.
