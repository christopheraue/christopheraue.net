So, yeah, my name is obviously Christopher Aue. I'm living in Germany in a city called M체nster. I moved here some years ago to study physics at the Westf채lische Wilhelms-Universit채t and graduated with a diploma in 2011. Having enough of science and research at the time I decided to turn my passion to profession which led me to join the startup [Gr체nspar](http://www.gruenspar.de) as a web developer. After two years of working there I quit to be able to explore the field of product development as a whole.

I'm passionate about useful products leveraging the possibilities of a connected world delivering a nice and clean user experience. I'm an efficiency fanatic knowing to be become more efficient it takes a fair amount of learning, rethinking and failing. I'm considering myself to be a generalist developing the right mix of deep knowledge in individual fields to be able to pull things of alone if necessary.

To balance things out for me I spend my free time doing Ving Tsun Kung Fu. It is a challenge for itself to get it working in sparring under pressure.
