Hi! My name is **Christopher Aue**. Right now, I'm working on **[Capp](http://www.getcapp.com)**, an app that let you save your complete work environment on your desktop so you can restore it at a later time.

I noticed, I basically set up the same applications, windows and files every time I continue to work on a task: Start IDE, load project, move window to left monitor, start browser, open ticket system, open gmail, move window to right monitor, open terminal, change directory, type command, move and resize window and so on and so forth. This has to stop. Set it up, save it and restore it whenever needed. No more than one mouseclick needed.
